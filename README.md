# Available Scripts:
⚠️ Globals/utility functions and classes are not in all of these scripts. You must implement them yourself.

These scripts are outdated from many, many sources ago - but still work:
- [Infinite Money](InfiniteMoney.lua): A fully functional Kool-Aid autofarm that produces the kool aid required for the Infinite Money vulnerability. Once cooking is finished, it performs the vulnerability by selling it.
- [InfiniteMoney (LTK Hub)](InfiniteMoney-LTK%20Hub.lua): A raw version of the Infinite Money vulnerability created by cytox at LTK Hub.
- [No Ragdoll / No Fall Damage](No%20Ragdoll.lua): Prevents you from ragdolling due to fall damage only. Other types of ragdolling will still happen.

These scripts are relatively fresher:
- [Movement Disabler](Movement%20Disabler.luau): Takes advantage of Roblox's beautiful replication to "disable" the server anticheat - this will let you speed however fast you want, jump however high you want, and teleport instantly anywhere.
- [Instant Prompts (OOP)](InstantPrompts.luau): Makes all Proximityprompts instant to interact with, including newly added prompts.
- [Instant Equip (OOP)](InstantEquip.lua): Inherits from the abstract GunSettings class - which detects all guns and modifies their settings to achieve instant equip time.
- [Studio Farm](StudioFarm.luau): Automatically robs the "On The Radar" studio, and will wait for cash to respawn before robbing again, and again, and again.

# Notice
Please respect the license (AGPL-3.0 license). You're allowed to use, modify, and even sell as long as you comply with this license. It is the unfortunate reality that most people using Luau "cheat/hack" code are anywhere aged 12 to 22 who simply seek to steal & seek profit from public code, with blatant disrespect to the license & authors. Please don't do this. View the condition of the license [here](LICENSE).
