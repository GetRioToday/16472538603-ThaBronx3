# Available Scripts:
⚠️ Globals/utility functions and classes are not in all of these scripts. You must implement them yourself.

These scripts are outdated from many, many sources ago - but still work:
- Infinite Money: A fully functional Kool-Aid autofarm that produces the kool aid required for the Infinite Money vulnerability. Once cooking is finished, it performs the vulnerability by selling it.
- InfiniteMoney (LTK Hub): A raw version of the Infinite Money vulnerability created by cytox at LTK Hub.
- No Ragdoll / No Fall Damage: Prevents you from ragdolling due to fall damage only. Other types of ragdolling will still happen.

These scripts are relatively fresher:
- Movement Disabler: Takes advantage of Roblox's beautiful replication to "disable" the server anticheat - this will let you speed however fast you want, jump however high you want, and teleport instantly anywhere.
- Instant Prompts (OOP): Makes all Proximityprompts instant to interact with, including newly added prompts.
- Instant Equip (OOP): Inherits from the abstract GunSettings class - which detects all guns and modifies their settings to achieve instant equip time.
- Studio Farm: Automatically robs the "On The Radar" studio, and will wait for cash to respawn before robbing again, and again, and again.
