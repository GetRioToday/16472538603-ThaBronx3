# Available Scripts:
⚠️ Globals/utility functions and classes are not in all of these scripts. You must implement them yourself.


- InfiniteMoney.lua: A fully functional Kool-Aid autofarm that produces the kool aid required for the Infinite Money vulnerability. Once cooking is finished, it performs the vulnerability by selling it.
- InfiniteMoney-LTK HUb.lua: A raw version of the Infinite Money vulnerability created by cytox at LTK Hub.
- NoRagdoll.lua: Prevents you from ragdolling due to fall damage. Other types of ragdolling will still happen.
- Movement Disabler.lua: Takes advantage of Roblox's beautiful replication to "disable" the server anticheat - this will let you speed however fast you want, jump however high you want, and teleport instantly anywhere.

- InstantPrompts.lua: (OOP based from our script rewrite) - Makes all Proximityprompts instant to interact with, including newly added prompts.
- InstantEquip.lua: (OOP based from our script rewrite) - Inherits from the abstract GunSettings class - which detects all guns and modifies their settings to achieve instant equip time.

# Notice
Please respect the license (AGPL-3.0 license). You're allowed to use, modify, and even sell as long as you comply with this license. It is the unfortunate reality that most people using Luau "cheat/hack" code are anywhere aged 12 to 22 who simply seek to steal & seek profit from public code, with blatant disrespect to the license & authors. Please don't do this. View the condition of the license [here](LICENSE).
